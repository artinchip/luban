	  CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools
	  designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used
	  to control the software compilation process using simple
	  platform and compiler independent configuration files, and
	  generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in
	  the compiler environment of your choice.
