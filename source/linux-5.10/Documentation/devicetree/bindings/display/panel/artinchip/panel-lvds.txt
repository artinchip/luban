ArtInChip LVDS Panel
======================

Required properties:
 - compatible: value should be "artinchip,aic-general-lvds-panel".
 - data-mapping: The color signals mapping order. See details in
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/lvds.yaml
 - data-channel: The name of the LVDS channel, specifying which channel to use, one of
 	- "single-link0"
 	- "single-link1"
 	- "double-screen"
 	- "dual-link"

 - port: the input port connected to the display interface

Optional properties:
 - backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel
 - enable-gpios: GPIO pin to enable or disable the panel
 - display-timings: timings for the connected panel as described by
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/display-timing.txt
 - disp-dither: This describes the output color depth.
   Make the image smoother when the output is 6 bit or 5 bit, otherwise discard
   the low bits directly. Allow the output color depth as RGB565, RGB666.
   The value defined by include/dt-bindings/display/artinchip,aic-disp.h

Example:

	panel_lvds {
		compatible = "artinchip,aic-general-lvds-panel";
		enable-gpios = <&gpio_a 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		data-mapping = "vesa-24";
		data-channel = "single-link1";
		status = "okay";

		port {
			panel_lvds_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lvds0_out>;
			};
		};

		display-timings {
			native-mode = <&timing0>;
			timing0: 1024x600 {
				clock-frequency = <60000000>;
				hactive = <1024>;
				vactive = <600>;
				hback-porch = <140>;
				hfront-porch = <160>;
				hsync-len = <20>;
				vback-porch = <20>;
				vfront-porch = <12>;
				vsync-len = <3>;
				de-active = <1>;
				pixelclk-active = <1>;
			};
		};
	};
