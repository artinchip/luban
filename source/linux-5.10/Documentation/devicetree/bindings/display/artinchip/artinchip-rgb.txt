ArtInChip RGB interface
=========================

Required properties:
- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0: the pincontrol settings to configure
   muxing properly for pins that connect to screen
- port@[0-1]: Port nodes with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
  Port 0 is the input port connected to the display engine,
  port 1 is the output port connected to a panel.

Optional properties:
- status: Should be "ok" or "disabled" for enabled/disabled. Default is "ok".

Example:

    &rgb0 {
    	pinctrl-names = "default";
    	pinctrl-0 = <&lcd_pins>;
    	status = "okay";

    	port@0 {
    		reg = <0>;
    		rgb0_in: endpoint {
    			remote-endpoint = <&de0_out>;
    		};
    	};

    	port@1 {
    		reg = <1>;
    		rgb0_out: endpoint {
    			remote-endpoint = <&panel_rgb_in>;
    		};
    	};
    };
