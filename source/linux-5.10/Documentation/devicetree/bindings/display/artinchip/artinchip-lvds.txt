ArtInChip LVDS interface
==========================

Required properties:
- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0: the pincontrol settings to configure
   muxing properly for pins that connect to screen
- port@[0-1]: Port nodes with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
  Port 0 is the input port connected to the display engine,
  port 1 is the output port connected to a panel.

Optional properties:
- status: Should be "ok" or "disabled" for enabled/disabled. Default is "ok".
- sync-ctrl: Enabled/Disabled Sync mode. Avoid enabling the lvds display interface
  when the display engine gives field data. Default is 1.
- pols: LVDS signal polarity control. Default is 0
- phys: LVDS signal PHY control. Default is 0x3A
- swap: Solve LVDS signal crossover and avoid layout winding by
  switching channels through software control. Default is 0

Example:

	lvds0 {
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&lvds0_pins>;
		status = "okay";

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			lvds0_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&de0_out>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			lvds0_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&panel_lvds_in>;
			};
		};
	};
