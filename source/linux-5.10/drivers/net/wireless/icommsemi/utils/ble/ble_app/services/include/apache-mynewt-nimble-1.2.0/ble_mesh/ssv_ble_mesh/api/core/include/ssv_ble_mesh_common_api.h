 * @brief         Initialize BLE Mesh module.
 *                This API initializes provisioning capabilities and composition data information.
 *
 * @note          After calling this API, the device needs to call ssv_ble_mesh_prov_enable()
 *                to enable provisioning functionality again.
 *
 * @param[in]     prov: Pointer to the device provisioning capabilities. This pointer must
 *                      remain valid during the lifetime of the BLE Mesh device.
 * @param[in]     comp: Pointer to the device composition data information. This pointer
 *                      must remain valid during the lifetime of the BLE Mesh device.
 *
 * @return        SSV_BM_OK on success or error code otherwise.
